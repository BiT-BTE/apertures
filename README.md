Tectonica by BiT is a research project funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and led by Prof. Ana Tajadura-Jiménez. The project will run from January 2022 to December 2026 within the Department of Computer Science at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain.

# Objective
The main objective of Tectonica by BODYinTRANSIT is to share our advances in haptic prototypes develoment related with Body Transformation Experience (BTE).

# Prototypes
Our prototypes deliver sensory feedback, such as sound, vibrations, mechanical touch, etc. Among them is Tectótica, a series of prototypes dedicated to creating haptic sensory stimulation through various types of actuators.
